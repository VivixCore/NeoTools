/*

	Brief list of things that need to get finished:

	>>Actual Coding
	- Events dependent on time of day (snowager, magma pool) aren't implemented
	- Eventually figure out why SDL_WM_SetIcon is being weird
	- Settings icon blocks

	>>Settings
	- Possibly save/load configurations of icons instead of using one config
	- Possibly save state of each icon block on close

	>>Categories, Banners, Pictures
	- Battledome everything
	- World Map
	- Shops/Restocking: lots of work to be done here

	>>Documentation
	- Documentation on link icon format on a per-type basis
	- Help documentation
	- Documentation on about needs finishing
	- Prettifying of all documentation
